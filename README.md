# Fallout 2 Clone - Rolling Scopes School

The Fallout 2 clone repository, developed in a team with [Alina](https://github.com/AlinaLaniuk) and [Kirill](https://github.com/slysnek) as part of the final four-week project at the [Rolling Scopes School - Javascript](https://rs.school/js/) courses. Thank you guys for these 4 weeks, it was cool to work with you as a team! As for me, the project turned out to be awesome for the first game. But I'm not into game development anymore))
